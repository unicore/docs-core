## Двойная Спираль
### Квант
Вспомогательная внутренняя условная единица. При помощи текущего курса квантов производятся математические расчеты прибыли, измеряемой в жетоне обращения. Курс покупки и продажи растет по мере полного выкупа квантов из текущего пула.

### Курс покупки
Курс, по которому кванты выкупаются у партнеров.

### Курс продажи
Курс, по которому кванты продаются партнеров.

### Пул
“Бассейн“, “Раунд», “Пакет“  - строго фиксированное количество квантов, предлагаемое к реализации партнерам при каждом очередном повышении курсов. 

### Заполнение пула
Полная реализация партнерам всех квантов в данном пуле.

### Свой пул
Пул, в котором партнер получает ПРИБЫЛЬ при сдаче квантов.

### Чужой пул 
Пул, в котором партнер несет ПОТЕРИ при сдаче квантов в жетоне обращения.

### Добродел


### Центр 
Вариант настроек двойной спирали. Операционная система позволяет одновременно запускать несколько центров, отличающихся разными процентами возможной прибыли и потерь. Партнер имеет возможность выбора, в каком центре (или в каких центрах) участвовать.

### Цикл
Этап развития двойной спирали, где все правила для предыдущего этапа развития сохраняются. 

### Событие насыщения 
Граница перехода между двумя циклами. Насыщение цикла наступает в случае, когда в течение определенного времени текущий пул не закрывается. В этом случае открывается новый цикл и развитие продолжается с первого пула в следующем цикле.

Squash merging is a `merge` option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a `pull request`.

### Stablecoin[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#stablecoin)

### Standby BP[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#standby-bp)

### TaPoS - Transaction as Proof of Stake[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#tapos---transaction-as-proof-of-stake)

`TaPoS` is used to ensure that a user fetches the recent state of the top of the blockchain to prove that they are aware of the state of the chain when signing a transaction. This helps to prevent certain forms of attacks, such as a replay attack where a malicious user tries to replay a transaction, despite the state of the associated accounts having already been changed.

---

### TestNet[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#testnet)

A test `network` or `testnet` is an instantiation of the EOSIO platform that is intended for testing purposes. Generally, the native token has no value and is given away to developers so they can test.

---

### Tokens[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#tokens)

### UAL (Universal Authenticator Library)[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#ual-universal-authenticator-library)

Developed by EOSIO Labs, the [Universal Authenticator Library (UAL)](https://github.com/EOSIO/universal-authenticator-library) allows app developers to integrate with a variety of authenticators (wallets, app explorers, key managers, etc.) by coding to a single, universal API.

## **V**[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#v)

### Vote[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#vote)

Voting is a fundamental part of the system. The most widely used application of voting is to elect which Block Producers will actually produce blocks for the network. Voting will also be used to help collect the communal decisions through which we will change the course of the network.

---

### Vote Decay[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#vote-decay)

To discourage users from casting a vote for Block Producers and then not updating their `vote` periodically, a decay in the relative vote strength of old votes was introduced. To maintain maximum vote strength, a user should vote at least once per week.

---

## **W**[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#w)

### Wallet[#](https://guide.eoscostarica.io/docs/tools/glossary#wallet)
